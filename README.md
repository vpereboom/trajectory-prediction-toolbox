# Aircraft Trajectory Propagation and Conflict Detection Toolbox

This repository contains the code supporting my Msc. Thesis work on the topic of Trajectory Propagation & Conflict Detection for aircraft using ADS-B data.

It contains modules for both data processing as well as the analytical methods involved.

A PostgreSQL database was used in the backend for data storage.
